# My Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal configurations, known as "dotfiles," which customize my environment on Unix-like systems, such as Linux. Having my dotfiles in a repository makes it easy to synchronize settings across different machines and share them with others.


## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your machine:

```shell
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
  cd ~/dotfiles
  ./install.sh
```
